# Macadamia

> Simple script to split one markdown file into multiple files.

## What is it?

I used to write my notes in one big markdown file. With time, it become a big file, and I wanted to split it into multiple files, one per day.
This script does exactly that.
It will create one file per day, and put the content of the day in it.
It will also convert the date in the file name to a more readable format (from DD/MM/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD).

## How to use it?

```bash
ruby macadamia.rb <input_file_path>
```

## Why macadamia?

Because names should be fun.
